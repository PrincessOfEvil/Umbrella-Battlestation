umbrella_chen,SHIP,"Armed with four whole miniguns, the Chen-class superheavy combat drone is sure to bring pain where it doesn't belong. The drone uses a unique, delta-class AI core, which is automatically recovered and put into a new drone on hull failure. That, along with the sheer logistical profile required to maintain a destroyer-sized hull, makes it extremely difficult to fit into any but the largest of carriers.",,,,
umbrella_ran,SHIP,"The unique system of this drone allows it to deploy a single superheavy drone of its own. The drone uses a unique, beta-class AI core, and its support equipment allows recovery of every non-disposable part of it.",,,,
umbrella_fighter_recursivedrone,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches and supports a Chen-class superheavy combat drone.,Special,Allows the ship to control its own drone.,,
umbrella_starpulsar,WEAPON,"More of an experimental test bed than a real weapon, the Star Pulsar lauches small phase-tethered beacons that cause the main weapon to strike anything they touch with an extremely powerful brane scythe. The beacons are reusable and are automatically recovered right before the strike. Unusual power signatures, and the lack of public API, cause TriPads to misreport the weapon's statistics.",,
umbrella_chaingun_l,WEAPON,"A short-range rapid-fire danmaku weapon with more than enough firepower for its size. Green Wings are traditionally placed on the left slots of a ship, owing to the early versions having chiral topological defects that interfered with thrusters. The beacons are reusable and are automatically recovered right before the strike. Unusual power signatures, and the lack of public API, cause TriPads to misreport the weapon's statistics.",,
umbrella_chaingun_r,WEAPON,"A short-range rapid-fire danmaku weapon with more than enough firepower for its size. Blue Wings are traditionally placed on the right slots of a ship, owing to the early versions having chiral topological defects that interfered with thrusters. The beacons are reusable and are automatically recovered right before the strike. Unusual power signatures, and the lack of public API, cause TriPads to misreport the weapon's statistics.",,
