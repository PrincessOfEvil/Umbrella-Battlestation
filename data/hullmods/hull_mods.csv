The flux dissipation rate, including that of additional vents, is increased by a factor of %s.

Reduces the peak performance time by a factor of %s, prevents the use of active venting, and drastically reduces weapon ranges past %s units.

Can not be installed on civilian or capital ships.","Drastic improvement in performance, much lower peak time.",graphics/hullmods/safety_overrides.png

Increases speed while phased by %s. Phase slipping due to high flux is completely removed. Increases phase flux by %s.

All crew, including officer staff and AI cores, is required to put on phase-shielded suits while phase coils are in use. No punishment for breaking this rule is required.","Massively increases speed while phased, at the cost of flux.",graphics/hullmods/augmented_drive_field.png
